											<h2>Who are we?</h2>
											<h3>ALX Students with a huge ambition</h3>
										</header>
										<p><b>
											Welcome to our platform, where we strive to support job seekers and learners across Africa in their journey towards finding meaningful employment and achieving their learning goals. Our platform is the result of a collaboration between members of the ALX community, who recognized the challenges posed by structural unemployment in Africa and the need for accessible and effective learning resources to address this challenge.
										</b>
										</p>
										<p>
											As part of ALX Foundation's program, we have worked to create a platform that provides a range of resources and tools for job seekers and learners to enhance their skills, knowledge, and career prospects. Our platform offers a comprehensive selection of e-learning courses and training programs, as well as job listings and career development resources, to support our users in their pursuit of meaningful employment and career growth.
										</p>
										<p>
											At our core, we are committed to empowering individuals across Africa with the knowledge, skills, and resources they need to succeed in the rapidly evolving job market. We believe that by providing access to high-quality learning resources and job opportunities, we can help to combat the rise of unemployment and contribute to a brighter future for individuals and communities across Africa.
										</p>
										<p>
											We are passionate about supporting job seekers and learners at every stage of their journey, from exploring new career paths and learning new skills to finding meaningful employment and advancing their careers. Our platform is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with a range of resources and tools to meet the needs of diverse learners and job seekers. We invite you to join us on this journey towards a brighter future for Africa.
