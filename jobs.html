											<h2>How to get a job</h2>
											<h3>A generic three column layout</h3>
										</header>
										<p>There are many ways to get a job. Approaches vary depending on the type of job you’re after, 
											and the industry and competitiveness of the job. Some may find networking and personal 
											connections effective in their job search, but many people rely on the traditional approach 
											of applying to and interviewing for a job. The process can be daunting, but these strategies 
											can help you gain clarity and confidence as you embark on your journey.
											1. Reflect on your career aspirations. 
											While you might try to sit down and apply for any job that you’re qualified for, 
											taking the time to assess your career hopes and dreams can be a more satisfying 
											and productive way to start a job search. Thinking about what makes you come alive 
											can help you narrow down your search to target specific roles and careers.
										</p>
										<p>
											2. Research potential industries and job roles.
Next, think about the types of industries or roles that you either have experience in or that pique your interest. Research everything you can about the food and beverage industry, for example, if that’s a business area that interests you. Have you considered a career in IT, data analysis, marketing, or UX design?

Say you have a degree in marketing; are you interested in pursuing a career in that field? If so, do you want to work for an agency or in-house for a company or non-profit? What type of marketing do you hope to specialize in—perhaps social media marketing, digital marketing, or content marketing? Drill down in your search to understand the different roles you could play within a field or industry.

If you’re thinking more about your lifestyle, consider remote jobs, jobs that let you travel, or jobs better suited for introverts.
										</p>
										<p>
											3. Identify your transferable skills.
Once you have a better idea of your career goals and what types of jobs you’re interested in, think about how your experiences can apply to these roles. Identify your transferable skills, including technical skills and workplace skills you have acquired in your personal and professional life. 

If you are seeking your first job, your transferable skills might come from extracurricular activities, volunteer work, or daily life (for example, taking care of children or siblings). For those switching jobs or changing careers, you can mine previous work experiences for technical skills like data analytics or data entry, and workplace skills like leadership, creativity, and critical thinking.
